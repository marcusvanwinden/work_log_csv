### Description

To prepare better timesheets for a company, I have been asked to develop a terminal application for logging what work someone did on a certain day. The script should ask for a task name, how much time was spent on the task, and any general notes about the task. The program records each of these items into a row of a CSV file along with a date. I also provided a way for a user to find all of the tasks that were done on a certain date or that match a search string.
