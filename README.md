### Description

In order to prepare better timesheets for your company, you've been asked to develop a terminal application for logging what work someone did on a certain day. The script should ask for a task name, how much time was spent on the task, and any general notes about the task. Record each of these items into a row of a CSV or JSON file along with a date. Provide a way for a user to find all of the tasks that were done on a certain date or that match a search string (either as a regular expression or a plain text search). Print a report of this information to the screen, including the date, title of task, time spent, and general notes.
